# OnlineShop with Blazor framework

Blazor uses CSharp instead of JavaScript for client-side web development. It renders the UI as HTML and CSS (using Razor syntax). The apps are based on components - pages, dialogs or data entry forms.
Blazor supports 2 hosting models:
- Server-side as part of an ASP.NET Core (3.0) Components
- Client-side in browser on WebAssembly (ASP.NET Core 3.1). Here the app is executed directly on the browser UI thread. This model is used in the current project (OnlineShop).
